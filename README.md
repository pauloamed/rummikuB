# rummikuB

## Rules
The game rules can be found at https://www.boardgamehalv.com/how-to-play-rummikub/ , but some of them are highlighted below:
- Each playerâ€™s initial move has to be at least 30 points
- A run is 3 or more in a row of the same color
- A group is 3 or more of the same number that are all different colors 
- In each turn, a person must either take an unknown tile from the sack or meld some pieces.

Currently, the following simplifications are being used:
- The player `0` is always the first to play
- There is only one round
